I used probably a good amount of stack Overflow to help us. I'll try nd remember all the sites

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14067547/how-switch-case-statement-implemented-or-works-internally
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/ //v hellpful for algorithms to place students and idle time
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49641801/how-to-make-a-generic-virtual-class-c (bc u said anything we did have our inclass just needed refresher)
Oddly enough, beginners like us needed some reference like this: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/211087/
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_exceptions_handling.htm //helpful for exceptions (in assignment.cpp)
In Assignment4.cpp we include "Queue" because the fist variable references Queue (front of)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19430933/g-undefined-symbols-for-architecture-x86-64/20444276#20444276
//Read this bc although we didnt have the error, still was better to read up on others mistakes
ALSO I USE QUEUE once from STL Library Im sorry I think
What to do to run:
1. g++ *.cpp  //to compile
2. ./a.out (.txt file you want to test (we have an example.txt which is just 2 more students that yours))
Ex: ./a.out example.txt

Any errors in Alex's I fixed in mine, he is popular and went to vegas with his bros. Mine compiles no issue, he said he was having some
inheritance/variable trouble.

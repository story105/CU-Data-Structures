Assignment 1

A couple things I did not understand, such as reading/writing to a file in cpp, random number generation syntax,
and, of course, what a guassianDistribution was. I'm in physics 108 right now and we know what a gaussian substance is,
but not what its distribution is. I thought it had only to do with charges.

Random number generation http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/ < very helpful general purpose functions
Reading/writing to a file http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/

And I did look at stack overflow questions but they did not help as much because they were specific questions that didn't apply to me.
So those two aforementioned links were the prevalent, helpful articles I found.

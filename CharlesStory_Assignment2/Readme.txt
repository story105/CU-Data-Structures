2. A LIST OF ALL SOURCE FILED SUBMITTED FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT
a. main.cpp Header.h HeaderCPP.cpp

3. A DESCRIPTION OF ANY KNOWN COMPILE OR RUNTIME ERRORS, CODE LIMITATIONS, OR DEVATIONS FROM ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS (IF APPLICABLE)
a. Two KNOWN errors, this code can't input and read a file, it just sits there, and doesn't pick up the necessary number for rows and columns, so take a look. 
Another error is output... real smart of me not knowing how to deal with string to char to int kinda things bc last assignment was literally output/input-BASED.
Anyway that's the only known, pause and enter go, and they all output to ya computer cool. Just you have to go random and design the sides :L

4. A LIST OF ALL REFERENCES USED TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT, INCLUDING PEERS (IF APPLICABLE)
a.  Alex Alvertos is my partner!
b. Helpful for switching between double and int!
https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/library-function/cmath/round
Found useful article on Random number generation using the time() function
while "seeding". time(null) will return the number of seconds elapsed
http://www.math.uaa.alaska.edu/~afkjm/csce211/handouts/RandomFunctions.pdf
This for string to int
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atoi/
and then this was for the "pause"? you asked for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4184468/sleep-for-milliseconds
sleep(1)
Helpful very for stringstrm : http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/stringstream/


5. INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE ASSIGNMENT
a. So do everything but try and read and write to a file. It's really awkward but the c_str() and atoi didn't work! the error just looks u in the face. Nothing happens when I tried reading a file,
just never exits, while the writing also never produced a file. It's lowkey embarrassing because the last project was output and input based...
